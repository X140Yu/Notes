>所以，面对程序设计，必须要有最求完美的态度，不断的修复，哪怕只是很小的瑕疵。当你拥有了这样的态度，甚至开始不自觉的有了些强迫症时，那么你自然就不会去随意命名一个函数、类或变量，不会随意的安放源代码的目录结构，不会让类与类之间的依赖纠缠不清；你会自觉的写好注释，会理所当然的构建完善的单元测试，会不断学习从前人的经验中找到解决自己觉得有坏气味的方法；随后你会深刻的理解设计模式的精妙，你会在各种模式最基础的模型下推算演化出属于自己的设计方式，最终，你淡忘了那些设计模式，你开始觉得自己的程序结构和那些知名的开源项目越来越贴近了，甚至你可以很轻松的站在设计者的角度理解他人的设计思想了，那么，这便是态度带给你的收获。

>如果你不幸呆在了一个搬砖的地方，天天被业务压得喘不过气来，我建议你宁可让你的项目延期被老板骂，也要把时间挤出来努力学习基础知识，多掌握一些技术（很多技术在思路上是相通的），因为，比起你的个人未来，项目延期被老板骂绩效不好拿不到奖金，都不是什么事。

## Life

- [Always Be Learning](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/always-be-learning-a4ed3fe09f26)

>I’ve also come to realize that the value from reading doesn’t come from quantity. I used to think it was way better to read twenty books than two. Now, I think what matters most is how much you retain. It’s a shame how many thousands of books I’ve completed that I can’t really tell you very much about. Nowadays, when I come across a book that pushes my thinking, I slow down. I highlight passages and take notes. Even before I’ve finished the book, I’m usually re-reading old passages to try and make sure I’ve internalized the lessons. For this reason, it can take me a long time to finish a book. (Sapiens took me three months; Made to Stick took me over a year.) Last year, I only read a handful of books, but each one had a much greater impact on my worldview.

- [避免决策疲劳]()

>避免决策疲劳。精力有限，无论大小决策都需要精力，不要纠结于那些小事（比如今天穿什么）。锻炼身体。转型过程可能比较漫长，身体一定要撑住。冥想。有奇效。

>If you find it hard to wake up excited about going to work in the mornings, ask yourself why.

>If you look back on your last six months and you can’t point to anything that’s been hard for you, question whether you are challenging yourself enough.

>If you find yourself constantly looking for other people to tell you how awesome you’re doing, consider if you’re shortchanging your own growth and development.

>If your manager is not giving you the support or coaching you’d like, tell her how you’d like to be supported or coached.

>If working at your current company is not aligned with your long-term goals or values, consider making a move.

>If you’ve never thought about where you’d like to be in three years, sit down and think about it.
